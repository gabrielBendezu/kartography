# Kartography

Kartography is a collaborative web application for creating interactive historical or fantastical maps with timeline functionality. Users can build custom maps, collaborate in real-time, and visualize changes over time through animated timelines. It also includes the creation of switchable map modes like those present in Paradox games.
